# About Me
Programmer and loving husband.
My wife lives abroad and we are waiting for papers so she can come live here with me.
I had been putting off seeking an IT job for a bit believing that I might soon enough have to go get my wife and she is my top priority. It has been taking longer than most people would have experienced in the past due to backlog from covid. I am currently looking for an IT job.

# Coding Practices
For use of git version control on projects that I own, am the author of and have little to no users I rewrite git history. I would never do this in a work environment or for projects that have a decent amount of users. I would use git reverts instead. This means that for many of my projects my git histories do not display the amount of work and time I put into them. Even the projects that I overwrited history on I will state that I do such in the READMEs.
