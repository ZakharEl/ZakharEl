# About Me
I have an insatiable desire to learn. Since high school I have studied programming languages and foreign languages in my spare time. I have studied so many programming languages that I have some I didn't use for years and came back to to brush up on years latter. I run linux as my daily driver. I write many programs myself for finer control and/or automation. Many of these I don't even have on github.

# Coding Practices
For use of git version control on projects that I own, am the author of and have little to no users I rewrite git history. I would never do this in a work environment or for projects that have a decent amount of users. I would use git reverts instead. This means that for many of my projects my git histories do not display the amount of work and time I put into them. Even the projects that I overwrited history on I will state that I do such in the READMEs.
